# Fixability Score

To provide a repair-friendliness score for various products, we plan to evaluate them on the following:

* Does the manufacturer have a track-record of not changing the terms of the sale after the sale (for eg: soft-bricking after updates end)?
* What is the product's [iFixit repairability rating](https://www.ifixit.com/repairability)?
* Does the product have better-than-average warranty period for its segment?
* Are the warranty terms transparently and legibly disclosed before the sale?

* If the product uses batteries, are they replaceable/removable?
* Is the product made of standardized parts which can be bought from other vendors?
